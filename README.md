This is the source code for my [blog entry](https://code.darkroku12.ovh/6-log-classifier-part-1/).

Getting the `Android.log` file:
1. You can get the `Android.log` file at this [link](https://zenodo.org/record/3227177#.YRqa--VjSUk).
2. Decompress the log file and add it to the launching path of the application.

__Note:__ If you're using Visual Studio to build & run the project, the launch path is configured to be the root folder, which is the folder containing the `.sln` file.

C# .NET Core is available for Linux and MAC too, take a look at this [link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/run).
You can also run the project within your command line (without the need of Visual Studio), please, [see this tutorial](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/run) provided by Microsoft.
